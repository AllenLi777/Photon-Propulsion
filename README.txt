Photon Propulsion is a mod that adds a series of engines that shoot photons to the back of the ship to propell the ship forward. To avoid involving the theory of relativity, this mod adds a new resource called "Foton", which stands for "Fake Photon". You can believe me that everything in this mod is theoretically correct but not possible in the very near future. Our current technologies has not caught up with our frontiers in Physics and Chemistry.   :(

----------You will see "no theory of relativity" a lot in the mod, but actually this mod is just a workaround in Newtonian Physics to simulate the theory of relativity. I can promise that I have done serious calculations to make sure it is *mostly correct in Einstein's point of view.----------

Installation:
Please make sure that you have CommunityResourcePack installed--CRP is a hard dependency of Photon Propulsion. Photon Propulsion won't work without CRP.
To install, drag your downloaded folder: .../PhotonPropulsionRelease/GameData/PhotonPropulsion
