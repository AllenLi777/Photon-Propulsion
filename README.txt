Photon Propulsion is a mod that adds a series of engines that shoot photons to the back of the ship to propell the ship forward. To avoid involving the theory of relativity, this mod adds a new resource called "Foton", which stands for "Fake Photon". You can believe me that everything in this mod is theoretically correct but not possible in the very near future. Our current technologies has not caught up with our frontiers in Physics and Chemistry.   :(
